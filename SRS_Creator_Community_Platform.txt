Software Requirements Specification for Creator Community Platform

1. Introduction

1.1 Purpose
The purpose of this Software Requirements Specification (SRS) is to define the requirements for a networking and collaboration platform designed for rising artists and influencers in the gig economy. This platform aims to empower users to leverage technology for finding collaborators, developing their craft, and harnessing community support to create content without restrictions. It addresses the challenges faced by new creators in building networks and competing with established professionals, enabling an "artis-preneurial" journey through AI-supported features and collaborative tools.

1.2 Scope
The platform will facilitate connections among artists and influencers, allowing them to browse profiles, send collaboration invites, chat, and manage projects. It includes AI-driven suggestions for collaborations, profile management, multimedia portfolios, and revenue-generating features like subscriptions and ads. The system will support B2C interactions for individuals in creative fields, with inspirations from dating apps, social media, and professional networks. Out of scope are direct financial transactions beyond subscriptions (e.g., no built-in payment for gigs), physical event management, or integration with external hardware beyond standard APIs.

1.3 Definitions, Acronyms, and Abbreviations
- AI: Artificial Intelligence – Refers to machine learning algorithms used for suggestions, content validation, and generation.
- B2C: Business-to-Consumer – The model targeting individual users.
- Gig Economy: A labor market characterized by short-term contracts or freelance work.
- Portfolio: A collection of multimedia (images, videos, audio) showcasing a user's work.
- SRS: Software Requirements Specification.
- UI: User Interface.
- UX: User Experience.

1.5 Overview
Section 2 provides an overall description of the product, including perspective, functions, and user classes. Section 3 details specific requirements, such as functional, performance, and other attributes.

2. Overall Description

2.1 Product Perspective
This platform is a novel solution in the creator economy, addressing gaps in existing tools like LinkedIn, Instagram, Facebook, Mandy.com, UpWork, and film school networks. These alternatives often favor established professionals, use corporate-oriented UIs, prioritize content sharing over collaboration, and demotivate newcomers through indirect comparisons. The proposed system draws inspiration from Gen-Z social media apps, dating apps for profile browsing, Instagram for portfolios, and LinkedIn for credibility, creating a vibrant, fun UI like a "creative gala." It positions users as "artis-preneurs" by enabling remote, cross-global collaborations without dependency on hiring entities.

2.2 Product Functions
The platform will:
- Allow users to create and manage "valid" profiles with portfolios and external links.
- Provide AI-based validation to prevent fake or repetitive content.
- Enable searching, filtering, and AI-suggested collaborations.
- Support communication via chats, group chats, and meeting invites.
- Include collaboration tools like virtual whiteboards, file sharing, and project management.
- Offer AI-assisted features, such as generating music for lyrics or portfolio creation.
- Display relevant ads and support premium subscriptions.
- Facilitate feedback, personality quizzes, and translations for diverse users.

2.3 User Classes and Characteristics
- Primary Users (Artists and Influencers): Individuals in creative fields, including visual arts (e.g., painters, photographers), performing arts (e.g., actors, musicians), literary arts (e.g., writers), design, digital arts, crafts, media arts, culinary arts, and others (e.g., architects, tattoo artists). Expected early adopters: Gen Z and Gen Alpha, tech-savvy, motivated by creative freedom, but often inexperienced and demotivated by traditional networks.
- Administrators: Platform operators managing approvals, ads, and system health (implied but not detailed in source document).

2.4 Operating Environment
- Hardware: Web-based platform accessible via desktops, laptops, tablets, and mobile devices.
- Software: Browser-compatible (e.g., Chrome, Safari) with potential mobile apps; backend supporting AI integrations (e.g., machine learning libraries).
- Network: Internet-required for real-time chats, AI suggestions, and collaborations; supports global access with translation features.

2.5 Design and Implementation Constraints
- UI must be vibrant, fun, and inspired by Gen-Z apps and dating interfaces.
- No contact info in profiles for safety.
- AI must handle content uniqueness, suggestions, and generation without external package installations beyond standard libraries.
- Compliance with data privacy standards (e.g., no unapproved sharing).
- Multilingual support via auto-translation.

2.6 Assumptions and Dependencies
- Users have access to internet and devices for multimedia uploads.
- External links (e.g., Instagram, YouTube) are valid and user-managed.
- AI dependencies assume availability of models for suggestions and generation.
- Revenue features depend on third-party ad partnerships and payment gateways.
- Platform starts free, with monetization added later.
