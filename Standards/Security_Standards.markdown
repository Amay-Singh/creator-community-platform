# Security Standards Document

**Version**: 1.1  
**Prepared by**: Orchestrator Agent  
**Date**: August 16, 2025

## 1. Purpose
Define security best practices for all agents to ensure compliance and data protection in any application, aligned with 2025 trends (e.g., OWASP Top 10 for LLMs/AI, Non-Human Identities).

## 2. Standards
- **OWASP Top 10 2025 Compliance**: Address LLM-specific vulnerabilities including prompt injection, sensitive information disclosure, supply chain vulnerabilities, improper output handling, and agentic AI security risks. Implement proper validation and sanitization for LLM inputs/outputs.
- **AI Security**: Mitigate model poisoning, data leakage in AI responses, and Non-Human Identities risks (API key exposure). Implement secure model serving with proper authentication and authorization for AI services.
- **Credentials Management**: Store in environment variables, Key Vault, or GitHub Secrets; never hardcode (2025 zero-trust emphasis for CI/CD). Use secure credential handling for multi-environment deployments.
- **Data Protection**: Use HTTPS, encrypt sensitive data (e.g., AES-256), implement least privilege access (e.g., role-based access control). Ensure GDPR compliance and data privacy for AI training data.
- **DevSecOps Integration**: Embed security earlier in development pipeline with automated security scanning, vulnerability management, and incident response. Use AI-driven security monitoring and anomaly detection.
- **2025 Trends**: Focus on agentic AI security, secure API authentication (OAuth 2.0), and comprehensive AI red teaming practices. Implement governance checklists for LLM applications.

## 3. Validation
- All security-related outputs must comply with these standards, enforced by the Guardian Agent.
- Non-compliance triggers refinement via [FEEDBACK_LOOP].
