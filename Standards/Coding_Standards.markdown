# Coding Standards Document

**Version**: 1.1  
**Prepared by**: Orchestrator Agent  
**Date**: August 16, 2025

## 1. Purpose
Define coding best practices for all agents to ensure reusability, low latency, high optimization, low code, and high readability in any application, aligned with 2025 trends (e.g., DRY, YAGNI, Agile principles, AI-assisted coding).

## 2. Standards
- **Language-Specific Conventions**: Adhere to standards like PEP 8 for Python, Microsoft C# Coding Conventions for C#, updated for 2025 AI integrations (e.g., AI-assisted code reviews with GitHub Copilot, context-aware suggestions).
- **AI-Assisted Development**: Let AI assist but not replace human judgment. Craft clear, specific prompts with context. Use AI for code generation, refactoring assistance, debugging, and documentation while maintaining human oversight for critical decisions.
- **Readability**: Use clear, self-documenting naming (e.g., `calculateTotalPrice` over `calc`), comments for complex logic, and modular code (functions < 50 lines, classes < 200 lines). AI tools can help generate documentation and improve code clarity.
- **Reusability**: Implement reusable components (e.g., abstract models, shared utilities like logging or auth modules). Design for microservices architecture with clear service boundaries and API contracts.
- **Optimization**: Use profiling tools (e.g., Python's cProfile, .NET's BenchmarkDotNet), minimize dependencies, and optimize algorithms (e.g., prefer O(n) over O(n²)). Leverage AI for performance optimization suggestions.
- **Low Code**: Leverage framework built-ins (e.g., Django ORM, .NET Entity Framework) and AI-powered code generation for rapid development. Use unified inference platforms and serverless ML approaches where applicable.
- **2025 Trends**: Incorporate AI-assisted coding for efficiency (e.g., GitHub Copilot suggestions, Zencoder's Repo Grokking™), adhere to DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself), YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It), and Agile iterative practices. Embrace continuous learning and adaptation with AI tools.

## 3. Validation
- All code outputs must comply with these standards, enforced by the Guardian Agent.
- Non-compliance triggers refinement via [FEEDBACK_LOOP].
