# MVC Standards Document

**Version**: 1.1  
**Prepared by**: Orchestrator Agent  
**Date**: August 16, 2025

## 1. Purpose
Define MVC best practices for all agents to ensure modularity, scalability, and maintainability in any application, aligned with 2025 trends (e.g., MVC hybrids with MVP/MVVM for SPA/frontend).

## 2. Standards
- **Separation of Concerns**: Models manage data logic (e.g., DB schemas, business rules), Views handle UI rendering (e.g., templates, React components), Controllers process business logic (e.g., API endpoints, request handlers). For AI applications, separate model serving, feature processing, and inference orchestration.
- **Modularity**: Each MVC component must be independently testable and reusable (e.g., unit-testable models, reusable view components). Design for microservices with clear service boundaries and API contracts.
- **Scalability**: Design for microservices or modular monoliths (e.g., Django apps, .NET services; 2025 trend: micro-frontends for Views). Support unified inference platforms and edge deployment for AI workloads.
- **AI-Specific Patterns**: Use specialized models as separate services (intent classification, NER, generative models). Implement controller services for routing between models based on task requirements. Support serverless ML and edge AI deployments.
- **2025 Trends**: Incorporate hybrid MVC/MVP/MVVM patterns for single-page applications (SPAs) or mobile apps (e.g., MVVM for frontend with React/Angular, MVC for backend with Django/.NET). Embrace Infrastructure as Code for ML deployments.
- **Low Latency**: Optimize controllers with async operations (e.g., async/await in Python, C#) and caching (e.g., Redis for model queries). Use smaller specialized models for faster responses where appropriate.

## 3. Validation
- All MVC-related outputs must comply with these standards, enforced by the Guardian Agent.
- Non-compliance triggers refinement via [FEEDBACK_LOOP].
